## Building Documentation

This documentation is written in Markdown and can be viewed directly on GitHub or in any Markdown viewer. For a more polished presentation, you can use tools like MkDocs or Docusaurus to build a documentation website.

### Using MkDocs

To build a documentation website with MkDocs:

1. Install MkDocs:
   ```bash
   pip install mkdocs
   ```

2. Create an MkDocs configuration file (`mkdocs.yml`) in the project root:
   ```yaml
   site_name: WeHolo Documentation
   nav:
     - Home: docs/README.md
     - Project Overview: docs/overview.md
     - Getting Started: docs/getting-started.md
     - Architecture: docs/architecture.md
     - API Reference: docs/api/index.md
     - Database Schema: docs/database-schema.md
     - Authentication: docs/authentication.md
     - Development Guide: docs/development-guide.md
     - Deployment: docs/deployment.md
     - External Services: docs/external-services.md
   theme: readthedocs
   ```

3. Build and serve the documentation:
   ```bash
   mkdocs serve
   ```
